<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

// .git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample
#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

# Secure Environment Configuration with GPG and SOPS  
**Internal Engineering / DevOps / IT Security**  
**Status: Final (Ready for Disaster Recovery)**

---

## ğŸ” Purpose

This documentation outlines the complete strategy for securely managing environment configuration and secrets for the `core-services` Docker deployments, using **SOPS**, **GPG**, and a **Git-based repository**. It includes all critical steps required to replicate, restore, or recover the system even in the event of total personnel loss.

---
ğŸ“‚ Client Configuration Files

Each client has a dedicated folder inside clients/, which contains two types of files:

âœ… Public (versioned in Git)

config.yaml: Non-sensitive configuration (hostnames, ports, service URLs)

metadata.yaml: Metadata about the client environment (template version, environment name, etc.)

These files are safe to commit and provide useful audit trails, environment info, and config visibility.

ğŸ”’ Encrypted (via SOPS)

secrets.sops.yaml: All sensitive credentials (client secrets, tokens, passwords)

This file is always encrypted with GPG and validated before use.

---

## ğŸ§± Architecture Overview

### Components

- `core-envs-private` (Git repo): Holds encrypted secrets and configuration per client.
- `core-services`: Docker container using config.yaml decrypted from secrets.sops.yaml.
- `SOPS`: Handles encryption/decryption using GPG.
- `GPG`: Manages encryption keys.

### Deployment Flow

- `secrets.sops.yaml` is decrypted into `config.yaml` at deployment time.
- The decrypted config is mounted inside the container.
- `validate-repo.sh` ensures files are decryptable.

---

## ğŸ“¦ Repository Structure

```
core-envs-private/
â”œâ”€â”€ .sops.yaml                 # Encryption rules

â”‚       â””â”€â”€ sops_exe_readme.md
â”œâ”€â”€ clients/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ core-dev/              # Client-specific configuration
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ secrets.sops.yaml

â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ security_status.md     # Active key tracking
```

ğŸš§ Config Safety Validation

To ensure no sensitive data is accidentally stored in config.yaml, a helper script is available:

./validate-config-safety.sh

This script checks all clients/*/config.yaml files for dangerous keys such as:

client_secret

refresh_token

jwt_secret

internal_jwt_secret

password

token

If any are found, the script fails and alerts you. You can add it to pre-commit or CI pipelines.
---

## ğŸªŸ Windows Support

Windows users may place a local copy of `sops.exe` inside the folder:

```
tools/win64/
```

This folder is `.gitignored` and is not tracked by Git. However, it is preserved in the repo via a placeholder file: `sops_exe_readme.md`, which contains download instructions.

To use SOPS in Windows:

1. Download the binary from [SOPS releases](https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases).
2. Rename it to `sops.exe` and place it in `tools/win64/`.
3. Use it directly via:
   ```bash
   ./tools/win64/sops.exe -d clients/core-dev/secrets.sops.yaml
   ```

> âœ… Our scripts (like `validate-repo.sh`) detect Windows environments and automatically use this local binary if present.

---

## ğŸ§ª validate-repo.sh Enhancements

The validation script now supports **cross-platform use**, including Windows with Git Bash or WSL. It automatically selects the correct SOPS binary.

```bash
./validate-repo.sh --client=core-dev
```

- On **Linux/macOS**, uses `sops` from PATH
- On **Windows (Git Bash, MSYS, etc.)**, uses `tools/win64/sops.exe`

### â— Common Error on New Windows Machines

If you get this error:

```
Failed to get the data key required to decrypt the SOPS file.
gpg: public key decryption failed: No secret key
```

It means:

- The private GPG key is missing on your system.
- You must **import it first**, using:

```bash
gpg --import tools/private-key.asc
```

Then verify:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys
```

If the fingerprint does not match `C9B7D0EA72899E6D764D97279EE538D3A441F8D0`, something went wrong.

---

## ğŸ”‘ GPG Key Management

### Active Key Info

- **Fingerprint**: `C9B7D0EA72899E6D764D97279EE538D3A441F8D0`
- **Created**: 2025-05-31
- **Expires**: 2026-05-31
- **Key Size**: RSA 4096

### Backup Location (Do NOT lose)

- `private-key.asc.gpg` â†’ Stored in **OneDrive (Volaris)**
- `ownertrust.txt` â†’ Restores trust level
- `public-key.asc` â†’ Safe to share, stored in Git

ğŸ”’ Additional backups on **encrypted USB** and optionally **cloud vault** (e.g., S3 + KMS)

### Backup Scripts

- `tools/backup-gpg.sh` â†’ Generates backup files
- `tools/restore-gpg.sh` â†’ Restores key + trust on new machine

### Rotation Plan

Mandatory **yearly rotation** or earlier if needed.

#### Procedure:
1. Generate new key
2. Add to `.sops.yaml`
3. Re-encrypt all secrets with both keys
4. Test restore
5. Remove old key

---

## ğŸ”’ .sops.yaml Rules

```yaml
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: .*\.sops\.yaml$
    encrypted_regex: '^(.*)$'
    pgp: 'C9B7D0EA72899E6D764D97279EE538D3A441F8D0'
```

---

## ğŸ”§ Validation

```bash
./validate-repo.sh
```

- Decrypts all `*.sops.yaml` files
- Fails if any cannot be decrypted (e.g., expired key or missing access)

---

## ğŸš€ Deployment

Each client decrypts secrets locally into a temporary config, then starts containers:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourorg/core-envs-private.git && cd core-envs-private/clients/core-dev
sops -d secrets.sops.yaml > /etc/core-services/config.yaml
cp config.yaml /etc/core-services/
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## ğŸ“‘ Security Status File

Located at: `docs/security_status.md`

Tracks:

- Active key info
- Expiration
- Rotation schedule
- Backup confirmation
- Fingerprint explanation

---

## ğŸ§¯ If Alejandro Prado is Deadâ„¢

1. Clone the repo `core-envs-private`
2. Use `tools/restore-gpg.sh` on any machine with GPG installed
3. You will need the passphrase for `private-key.asc.gpg`.  
   If not stored in vault, **youâ€™re screwed**.
4. Once imported, you can decrypt all existing `*.sops.yaml` files.
5. Review `docs/security_status.md` to check key validity.
6. If key is expired or rotation is due, follow the documented rotation plan.

---

## âœ… Summary

This system guarantees:

- âœ… Seamless cross-platform support (Linux + Windows)
- âœ… Full recoverability via encrypted GPG key and trust
- âœ… Developer-ready with helper scripts and README-first workflow
- âœ… Zero plaintext secrets ever committed

---

## âš™ï¸ Example of use:

### Step 1: Encrypt the secrets

```bash
./tools/win64/sops.exe -e ./clients/core-dev/secrets.sops.yaml > ./clients/core-dev/secrets.tmp.yaml && mv ./clients/core-dev/secrets.tmp.yaml ./clients/core-dev/secrets.sops.yaml
```

### Step 2: Validate the encrypted yaml

```bash
./tools/win64/sops.exe -d ./clients/core-dev/secrets.sops.yaml
```

## ğŸ“ Appendix: What is a GPG Fingerprint?

A GPG fingerprint is a unique hash that identifies a specific GPG key. It is derived from the key material itself and is safe to publish.

### Why it's used

- To uniquely identify a key when encrypting
- To verify a public key's authenticity
- To track active and rotated keys in documentation and policies

### Why it's safe to include here

- A fingerprint does **not** expose your private key
- It does **not** reveal your passphrase
- It cannot be used to decrypt anything
- It is meant to be **shared publicly**

Publishing fingerprints is standard practice in secure systems and infrastructure environments. It helps ensure others are encrypting to the correct key.

# ğŸ” GPG Key Policy for core-envs-private

**Owner:** Alejandro Prado  
**Last updated:** 2025-05-31

This document outlines the policy for managing GPG keys used in the encryption and decryption of secrets in the `core-envs-private` repository, which is used for secure environment configuration across multiple clients.

---

## ğŸ¯ Objectives

- Ensure secrets remain decryptable across time, machines, and team members
- Minimize risk of key loss or unauthorized decryption
- Standardize backup, sharing, and rotation processes
- Enable smooth onboarding/offboarding of team members

---

## ğŸ—ï¸ Key Generation

- Keys must be **RSA 4096 bits**
- Keys should be generated using:

  ```bash
  gpg --full-generate-key

// tools/public-key.asc

# SOPS Binary Placeholder (Windows 64-bit)

This folder is intentionally kept in the repository to indicate the required location for the `sops.exe` binary on Windows.

- Download the binary from [SOPS releases](https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases), rename it to `sops.exe`, and place it here.
- This file prevents Git from ignoring the entire folder.
- The binary itself is ignored via `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive or platform-specific executables.
